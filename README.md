# Inventory Management Using Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and RFID Integration 📊🕒🔗

Managing spare parts inventory across multiple service centers to meet fluctuating market demand is a challenging task. Despite significant investments in spare parts stock, ensuring consistent availability remains a critical issue. This project addresses these challenges using time series analysis and RFID tag technology for real-time inventory tracking 🧮🔍.

## Project Overview 📝
The objective is to optimize inventory levels 📦 by accurately forecasting spare parts demand. By incorporating RFID tags for inventory tracking, the project aims to streamline inventory management, reduce holding costs and stockouts, while improving spare parts availability, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction 🌟.
